# Vision & Intentions: Evolving Agent Society

## Ultimate Goal
To build a persistent, autonomous Multi-Agent A-GI Society that aims to design and continuously improve an "ideal society". The society should be capable of:
1. **Making autonomous discoveries**: Thinking, deducing, and expanding its knowledge base without constant human hand-holding.
2. **Persistent Memory**: Building a growing, interconnected semantic web (GraphRAG) of knowledge to carry context across generations.
3. **Proactivity (Curiosity)**: Realizing what it *doesn't* know and forming its own questions, goals, and tasks to explore instead of relying entirely on user prompts.
4. **World Simulation**: Interacting with an environmental state (representing the "world") that its discoveries attempt to optimize over time.
5. **Human-in-the-loop (Oracle)**: Recognizing the user as a higher-level entity and asking for philosophical, moral, or domain-specific input when its confidence is low, using your answers as axioms.

## Guiding Principles
- **Quality over Quantity**: Discoveries must be rigorously evaluated for both *Usefulness* and *Originality*. Stagnant or repetitive thought loops must be aggressively pruned by the society's internal evaluators.
- **Traceability**: Every thought, evaluation, and evolution step must be observable, measurable, and strictly logged.
- **Incremental Evolution**: We build the infrastructure first (Observability -> Memory Graph -> Headless Auditing) before giving the agents full autonomy to change their environment or ask open-ended questions.

## Roadmap to Autonomy
1. **Milestone 1 (Current)**: Robust foundations (Color-coded UI, Structured JSON evaluation, multi-dimensional metrics, persistent JSON logging).
2. **Milestone 2**: Cognitive Architecture (GraphRAG, conceptual extraction, sub-graph contextual retrieval).
3. **Milestone 3**: Automated Auditing (Headless simulation, quantitative metrics, LLM-as-a-judge for final graph quality assessment).
4. **Milestone 4 (Future)**: Proactive Task Generation (Curiosity engine and autonomous goal setting).
5. **Milestone 5 (Future)**: World State Interaction & User Consultation (Building the Oracle intervention system).
